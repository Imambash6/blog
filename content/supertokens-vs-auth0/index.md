Hey there, fellow developers! Are you scratching your head trying to choose between SuperTokens and Auth0 for your authentication needs? Well, you're in the right place! In this deep dive, we'll compare these two popular authentication solutions, exploring their features, setup processes, and use cases. By the end, you'll have a clearer picture of which option might be the best fit for your project. So, let's jump right in!

## Do SuperTokens and Auth0 Work Differently?

At their core, SuperTokens and Auth0 share the same goal: to provide secure authentication and authorization for web applications. However, they differ in their approach and underlying architecture.

SuperTokens is an open-source, self-hosted solution that gives you full control over your authentication infrastructure. It's designed with a modular architecture, allowing you to pick and choose the components you need. This flexibility is great if you have specific requirements or want to customize your auth flow.

On the other hand, Auth0 is a cloud-based, managed service that handles authentication and authorization for you. It offers a comprehensive suite of features out of the box, making it easier to get started quickly without worrying about the nitty-gritty details of implementation.

## SuperTokens vs. Auth0 Key Feature Differences

Both SuperTokens and Auth0 offer a wide range of features to streamline authentication and authorization processes. Here's a high-level comparison of some key features:

- **Authentication Methods:** Both SuperTokens and Auth0 support a variety of authentication methods, including passwordless, social login, and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
  - **Social Login:** Auth0 provides an easy way to add popular social providers through their dashboard. They also allow you to add custom OAuth providers by entering the necessary details. SuperTokens supports any OAuth 2.0 provider, offering a simple callback function in your backend SDK to integrate custom providers.
  - **Passwordless:** Both solutions offer passwordless authentication options, such as magic links or one-time passwords (OTP).
  - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Auth0 has built-in support for an extensive number of MFA methods, while SuperTokens allows you to setup MFA with email/sms based OTP and TOTP. SuperTokens does provide extensibility, allowing you to build your own custom MFA flows, though that requires additional effort
- **Customization and Flexibility:** SuperTokens shines in terms of customization, allowing you to tailor almost every aspect of the authentication process. You can easily override backend APIs, customize UI components, and implement custom logic at various stages of the auth flow.

  Auth0, while less flexible, offers a range of customization options through its dashboard. You can modify email templates, add custom fields to sign-up forms, and use Auth0 Rules, Hooks, or Actions to add custom logic to the authentication process.
- **Open-Source vs. Managed Service:** SuperTokens is an open-source solution that you host and manage yourself, while Auth0 is a managed service. This fundamental difference impacts many aspects of how you'll work with each solution, but we'll delve deeper into this in a later section.
- **Scalability and Performance:** Both solutions are designed to handle high loads, but their approaches differ:
  - **SuperTokens:** Being self-hosted, you have control over the infrastructure, allowing you to optimize performance based on your specific needs. You can scale horizontally by adding more instances of the SuperTokens core.

## Workflow Differences: Using Each Tool to Design a User Access Flow

To better understand the practical differences between SuperTokens and Auth0, let's walk through the process of designing a user access flow with each solution.

### Designing a User Access Flow with SuperTokens

![SuperTokens design flow](./st-flow.png)

#### 1. Set up the SuperTokens core and select the required modules

- Choose between self-hosting or using SuperTokens' managed service.
- If self-hosting, download and run the SuperTokens core:

```bash
docker run -p 3567:3567 -d registry.supertokens.io/supertokens/supertokens-mysql
```

#### 2. Install and configure frontend and backend SDKs:

- **Backend (Node.js/Express example)**

 ```javascript
 import supertokens from "supertokens-node";
 import Session from "supertokens-node/recipe/session";
 import EmailPassword from "supertokens-node/recipe/emailpassword";
 supertokens.init({
     framework: "express",
     supertokens: {
         connectionURI: "http://localhost:3567",
     },
     appInfo: {
         appName: "MyApp",
         apiDomain: "http://localhost:3000",
         websiteDomain: "http://localhost:3000"
     },
     recipeList: [
         EmailPassword.init(),
         Session.init()
     ]
 });
 ```

- **Frontend (js example)**

```javascript
import SuperTokens from "supertokens-auth-react";
import Session from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/session";
import EmailPassword from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/emailpassword"
SuperTokens.init({
    appInfo: {
        appName: "MyApp",
        apiDomain: "http://localhost:3000",
        websiteDomain: "http://localhost:3000"
    },
    recipeList: [
        EmailPassword.init(),
        Session.init()
    ]
});
```

#### 4. Implement custom UI components or use pre-built ones

- Use SuperTokens' pre-built UI:

```javascript
import { getSuperTokensRoutesForReactRouterDom } from "supertokens-auth-react/ui";
<Routes>
    {getSuperTokensRoutesForReactRouterDom(require("react-router-dom"))}
    <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
</Routes>
```

- Or create custom components using SuperTokens' hooks.

#### 5. **Add session verification middleware to protected routes:**

```javascript
import { verifySession } from "supertokens-node/recipe/session/framework/express";
app.get("/api/user", verifySession(), async (req, res) => {
    let userId = req.session.getUserId();
    // Handle user data
});
```

#### 6. Handle authentication events and user data management

- Use SuperTokens' APIs to manage users, sessions, and authentication events.

### Designing a User Access Flow with Auth0

![Auth0 flow](./st-auth0-flow.png)

#### 1. Create an application in the Auth0 dashboard

- Log in to Auth0, go to "Applications" > "Create Application"
- Choose your application type (e.g., Single Page Application)

#### 2. Configure authentication providers and settings

- In the Auth0 dashboard, set up social connections, database connections, etc.
- Configure settings like callback URLs and allowed origins.

#### 3. Install and configure the Auth0 SDK

- Install the Auth0 SDK

```typescript
npm install @auth0/auth0-react
```

- Set up the Auth0Provider in your React app:


```typescript
import { Auth0Provider } from "@auth0/auth0-react";


ReactDOM.render(
    <Auth0Provider
        domain="YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN"
        clientId="YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
        redirectUri={window.location.origin}
    >
        <App />
    </Auth0Provider>,
    document.getElementById("root")
);

```

####  4. Set up API routes and add Auth0 middleware for protection:

- Install necessary packages

```typescript
npm install express-jwt jwks-rsa
```

- Setup middlware

```typescript
const jwt = require('express-jwt');
const jwksRsa = require('jwks-rsa');


const checkJwt = jwt({
    secret: jwksRsa.expressJwtSecret({
        cache: true,
        rateLimit: true,
        jwksRequestsPerMinute: 5,
        jwksUri: `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/.well-known/jwks.json`
    }),
    audience: 'YOUR_API_IDENTIFIER',
    issuer: `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/`,
    algorithms: ['RS256']
});


app.get('/api/private', checkJwt, function(req, res) {
    res.json({message: 'This is a private endpoint!'});
});
```

#### 5. Use Auth0 hooks or rules for custom logic during the authentication flow:

- In the Auth0 dashboard, go to "Actions" > "Flows"
- Choose a flow (e.g., Login) and add custom actions
- Example action to add user roles:

```typescript
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
    const namespace = 'https://myapp.com';
    if (event.authorization) {
        api.idToken.setCustomClaim(`${namespace}/roles`, event.authorization.roles);
        api.accessToken.setCustomClaim(`${namespace}/roles`, event.authorization.roles);
    }
};
```

Both SuperTokens and Auth0 offer flexible ways to implement user authentication, but they differ in their approach. SuperTokens gives you more control over the entire process, allowing for deep customization at every step. Auth0, on the other hand, abstracts away much of the complexity, offering a more streamlined setup process with powerful customization options through its dashboard and extensibility points.
