## Introduction

Why is user access management (UAM) important? Well, by implementing effective UAM, organizations ensure that only authorized individuals have access to the appropriate resources, maintaining security and organization. Additionally, effective UAM can protect organizations from cyber attacks, safeguarding their resources and sensitive information.

One of the popular choices for implementing robust UAM is Stytch. However, it may not be the best fit for every organization’s unique needs. In this article, we will explore various alternatives to Stytch, highlighting solutions that provide the features that certain organizations require such as customization and flexibility.

## When To Start Considering Stytch Alternatives

If your current authentication framework lacks in aspects such as sufficient customization, robust security, ease of integration, or has pricing that doesn't fit your budget, it may be time to consider alternative solutions.

According to some Stytch reviews, there are a few issues that users face with the platform, which might push them to seek other alternatives, such as:

### Lack of branding customization

Although Stytch offers a white label feature, some users are disappointed with the limited branding options available. Specifically, the "Powered by Stytch" note that appears in the SSO (Single Sign-On) email can diminish a fully branded user experience. Organizations that prioritize complete control over their branding may find this feature insufficient. They often seek more customizable options to ensure their branding is consistently presented to their users without any third-party mentions.

### Dependency on the Stytch team for problem-solving

While the Stytch support team is known for being highly responsive and helpful, the dependency on them for resolving certain issues can be inconvenient for users. Some problems require intervention from the Stytch team, preventing users from independently troubleshooting and resolving these issues. This reliance can lead to delays and frustration, particularly when an immediate fix is needed. Enhancing user autonomy through a self hosted solution would help alleviate some of these issues while being open source would be the gold standard.

### Limited compatibility

Despite Stytch’s compatibility with most platforms, there are instances where it does not support certain systems. This limitation can restrict its usability for some users who rely on those specific platforms. Organizations with diverse technological ecosystems may find this lack of universal compatibility a significant drawback, as it could necessitate additional integrations or alternative solutions to bridge the gap, adding complexity and potential costs to their setup.

### Limited functionality of the planning board

The planning board feature in Stytch is often criticized for not fully addressing the needs of management. Users find that it lacks the comprehensive capabilities required for effective planning and project management. As a result, they often need to supplement it with additional tools or employ various workarounds to achieve their desired outcomes. This gap can hinder efficiency and complicate workflow integration, leading to frustration among management teams who expect a more robust planning solution from the platform.

### Lengthy grouping process

The software’s process for grouping items or users can be quite burdensome and time-consuming. This inefficiency can significantly slow down workflow, especially in dynamic environments where quick organization and reorganization are crucial. Users often find themselves spending more time than anticipated on this task, which lowers overall productivity and can lead to delays in project timelines. Streamlining this process would greatly enhance user experience and operational efficiency.
